# HR-application-API
An API building using NodeJs and the Express framework that handles simple routine HR tasks. 

The API handles requests for meetings, and allows one to have a simple record of the daily tasks of an employee within the company. 

The functions that handle the HTTP calls are found within the Server folder along with the database used. 

A nonSQL js databased is used to make this a persistent API.
